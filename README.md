# RL-SC2 (A DRL Learning Environment)

RL-SC2 is a DRL learning environment for DeepMind's [PySC2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2/blob/master/README.md) interface. It's specifically tailored down for reinforcment learning, with essential components like replay buffer and trajectory generating by interacting with PySC2. It can be used as a boilerplate to speed up your own design of agents.

The ultimate goal is to reproduce DeepMind's [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z.epdf?author_access_token=lZH3nqPYtWJXfDA10W0CNNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PSZcPzJFGNAZhOlk4deBCKzKm70KfinloafEF1bCCXL6IIHHgKaDkaTkBcTEv7aT-wqDoG1VeO9-wO3GEoAMF9bAOt7mJ0RWQnRVMbyfgH9A%3D%3D), which shows super-human performance in real-time playing. Since there is no official code published, mistakes and differences are expected in this project.
